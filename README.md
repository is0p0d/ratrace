# ratrace
a game about rats
---

The desired game is a free-to-play, non-monitized, lightweight in-browser game.
The desired aesthetics of said game is a loose adherance to early 90's 3d games, such as wolfenstein. Though ideally the control of the camera would not be limited to x-axis rotation. Map design remains to be decided between wolfenstein style array maps or vector based maps like doom.

This readme is meant to be used as a specifications document that lays out elements that need to be achieved at various parts of the project, urgency determined as such:
[r] - Required
    Things that must be completed for the base function of the game to work
[f] -  Foundational
    things to make the game an actual game, more than just a technical demo
[o] - Optional
    things that would make the game feel more furnished "release" tier items
[s] - Stretch Goal
    nice things to have after a release :)
